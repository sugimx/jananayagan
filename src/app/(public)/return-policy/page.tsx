        {/* <div className="space-y-6 text-white leading-relaxed">
          <p>This Return, Refund, and Cancellation Policy ({"“Policy”"}) forms an integral part of the Terms and
          Conditions of Use of the Platform operated by SUGIMX Private Limited ({"“Company”"}, {"“we”"}, {"“us”"},
          {"“our”"}). By placing an order or making a booking on our website, mobile application, or allied
          services (collectively, the {"“Platform”"}), you ({"“User”"}, {"“Customer”"}) acknowledge and agree that you
          have read, understood, and accepted the terms contained herein. This Policy governs the
          circumstances, manner, and conditions under which requests for cancellation, replacement,
          return, or refund may be entertained.</p>

          <p>The Company expressly states that all products offered through the Platform are limited edition,
          pre-booked merchandise and/or specialized equipment supplied on a made-to-order basis, and
          accordingly, no cancellation or refund shall ordinarily be permissible once a booking has been
          confirmed and payment has been successfully processed. Customers are therefore advised to
          exercise due care and diligence at the time of placing their orders, as bookings shall be treated
          as final, binding, and irrevocable, save and except as otherwise provided herein.
          Cancellations initiated by the User shall not be permitted after successful confirmation of an
          order. The Company reserves the unilateral right, however, to cancel an order under exceptional
          circumstances, including but not limited to (a) non-availability of product due to unforeseen
          supply chain disruption; (b) technical errors in pricing, description, or booking process; (c)
          suspicion of fraudulent or unauthorized transaction; or (d) force majeure events beyond the
          control of the Company. In such cases, the User shall be duly notified, and any consideration
          received shall, subject to applicable deductions, be refunded to the original mode of payment
          within a commercially reasonable timeframe.</p>

          <p>With respect to returns and replacements, the Company clarifies that products once delivered
          shall not be eligible for return, save and except where the product delivered is materially
          defective, damaged in transit, or not in conformity with the description published on the
          Platform. In such cases, the Customer shall be required to notify the Company in writing within
          forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of delivery, supported by photographic or video evidence
          demonstrating the alleged defect or discrepancy. The {"Company's"} decision, based upon
          inspection and verification (which may be carried out directly or through authorized logistics
          partners), shall be final and binding as to whether the claim is admissible. Where approved, the
          Company may, at its sole discretion, either arrange for replacement of the defective/damaged
          product,subject always to availability of stock and logistical feasibility.Under no circumstances
          shall any refund or monetary compensation be provided.</p>

          <p>Refunds, where sanctioned, shall be processed only to the original source of payment and not
          by way of cash or alternate methods, and the amount refunded shall be net of applicable
          charges,expenses, or administrative costs incurred by the company. The timeline for crediting
          such refunds shall be subject to the policies of the respective banks, payment gateways, or
          financial institutions involved. The Company disclaims all liability for delays attributable to such
          third parties. Under no circumstances shall any interest or compensation be payable on
          refunded amounts.</p>

          <p>The Company further reserves the right to reject return, replacement, or refund claims if (a) the
          product has been used, altered, tampered with, or handled negligently; (b) the claim is raised
          beyond the stipulated time; (c) requisite supporting evidence is not furnished; or (d) the
          complaint is, in the {"Company's"} reasonable opinion, frivolous, malicious, or abusive.</p>

          <p>This Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. All disputes,
          controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Policy shall be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the competent courts situated at Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu.</p>
